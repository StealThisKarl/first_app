Ruby on Rails Tutorial First Application


This is something I made when I first started programming.  It's my first Git project and was made about the time I 
wrote my first bit of code.  In other words, it's of no interest to anyone but me.  To repay you for the time wasted
reading this readme, I will now present you with a poodle.

             _,_
            (;;;)
         ,__/a /;\ 
         (__   |;|_ 
          '--. \;/;)
             @\(,;)'\
              (;;)   '._
                \  /  _ '-.
                |||  |     `\ _
                |||`-.\  \  (;;)
               ((;;)   (;;).' \\
               (((_)  (((__)   (;)
               
Have a wonderful day.
